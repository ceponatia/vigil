# drizzle/

Generated SQL migrations only — the `drizzle-kit generate` output directory
configured in `drizzle.config.ts`. Never hand-edit a migration file after it
has merged; if a mistake needs fixing, generate a new migration on top of it.

The baseline migration lands with planning ID BOOT-04, generated from
`packages/db`'s first schema modules.

## Workflow

1. Change a schema module under `packages/db/src/schema/`.
2. Run `pnpm db:generate` to produce a new migration file here.
3. Review the generated SQL before committing it.
4. Run `pnpm db:migrate` to apply it.

Never run `drizzle-kit push` in this workspace — migrations are the only
path from schema to database, so the history here stays the reproducible
source of truth for every environment.

## Status

Empty. No migration exists yet.
